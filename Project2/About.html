                <p> Hello, and welcome to my website, my name is Damian Howard. I am currently a student at the
                    University of Colorado Boulder, studying for a degree in Technology, Arts and Media. I hope to one
                    day work on front-end development projects where I can put both my creative and technical skills to
                    work. </p>

                <h4> How old are you?</h4>
                <p class="smalltext"> I may not look it but I'm 21 years old!</p>
                <h4> What interests do you have outside of computer science?</h4>
                <p class="smalltext"> I have always been interested in music, and music theory. I also have interest in video games, anime, game design and grapic design. Luckily I have been able to develop a wide variety of skills through the TAM program at CU and I have been able to pursue my interests further, the results of my work can be seen on my projects page.</p>
                <h4> What projects are you most fond of?</h4>
                <p class="smalltext"> my favorite projects are the ones where I was able to flex my creative muscles, while also having a lot of technical details to work with. A few examples would be my Dark Souls fan page, Sound Composition project, as well as my photoshop projects. </p>
