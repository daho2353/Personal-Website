                <p class="smallheader"> Private Discord bot programmed in Python that performs misc. tasks. It has been one of my favorite things to program and I update it whenever I have free time. The bot uses the Python Discord library and the asyncio library to monitor discord servers and respond to certain keywords. When making new features for the bot I usually try do something new programming wise, for example some functions use File I/O, some use Regex, if/elif trees, variable dictionaries, and many more. This project is probaly my most in depth project to date. Clicking on the image will link you to the Git Hub repository for this bot.</p>

                <p class="smallheader"> Image link to my interactive Dark Souls fan page, This was one of my earlier creations in my software devolopment career. And while it may lack polish, it is a simple creative work that shows a little bit of my design philosophy. The page itself is meant to work as a wiki of sorts and was mostly created to practice linking between many webpages.</p>
