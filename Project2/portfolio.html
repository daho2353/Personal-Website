The bot uses the Python Discord library and the asyncio library to monitor discord servers and respond to certain keywords. When making new features for the bot I usually try do something new programming wise, for example some functions use File I/O, some use Regex, if/elif trees, variable dictionaries, and many more. Clicking on the image will link you to the Git Hub repository for this bot.</p>

The game is built in Unity using C#</p></a>
